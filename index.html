            <p class="mt-4">My wife and I looked for the best mosquito repellents online, but we quickly discovered that most of

            <p>The more we read, the more worried we got!</p>
            <p>Mosquitoes can <b>kill up to one million people a year</b> - twenty times more than snakes, which “only” kill
                50,000 people a year. And since you can't tell if a mosquito is carrying dengue, zika, malaria, or chikungunya,
                you’re far better off <b>ZAPPING</b> them than taking any chances!</p>

            <p><b>I didn't want my family to keep getting eaten alive by mosquitoes!</b> So, I asked my friends in the area if
                they had any tips or tricks for keeping the bugs away.</p>
            <p>The next morning, I woke up to some replies to my question about the best alternative to kill the bugs. But <b>the
                    one that stood out to me was this message from my friend Luke, who lives on a farm close to us.</b></p>
            <p>Turns out he'd been using this <b>new powerful anti-mosquito lamp</b> that <b>attracted, trapped, and killed all
                    sorts of bugs and mosquitoes</b> – and without using any toxic chemicals!</p>

            <p>The Zappify 2.0 unit has this cylinder design, so <b>it lures bugs from all angles.</b> You can put it in a corner

                <p>It's got a <b>powerful rechargeable battery</b>, which is great because you can use it without hooking it up to an

                <p>Zappify 2.0 has a <span class="highlight">newly developed powerful UV lamp</span> that uses frequencies that <b>attract thousands more mosquitoes than anything previously developed</b>.

                <p>From the instant you turn it on it begins to create <b>huge piles of dead bugs!</b> Which is proof that they are not getting on your kids and attacking them!</p>

                <p><b>I took Zappify 2.0 outside and set it up in my yard.</b> Since the website claims that <b>it can attract bugs that are up to half a mile away</b> (especially when it's dark), I wanted to test if it got rid of the mosquitoes around the house plus those in the surrounding area.</p>
                <p>What happened next <b>BLEW MY MIND</b>. Within <b>a matter of minutes</b>, I could no longer see, hear, or feel <b>ANY mosquitoes</b>.</p>
                <p>I checked under the plants and in the corners where bugs would hang out. I even asked my wife and daughter if they sensed any pesky bugs. All we could hear was an almost completely silent “buzz-zap” every time a mosquito would get wiped out by <a href="#" class="highlight">Zappify 2.0</a>.</p>

                                  <p>Tip #1. For best results, place Zappify 2.0 in the area you wish to use and leave it operating for at least two hours. This will rid the area of any mosquitoes beforehand.<br><br>
                                  Tip #2. Because the device relies on the LEDs to lure mosquitoes, minimizing ambient light in the background will give better results. Having too many lights on will be distracting and you may not see the results you expect.</p>
